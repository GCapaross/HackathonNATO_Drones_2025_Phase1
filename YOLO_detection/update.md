# YOLO Detection System - Development Log

## Project Overview
Developing a YOLO-based object detection system for RF signal detection in spectrograms as part of NATO hackathon. The goal is to detect and classify different types of RF signals (WLAN, Bluetooth, Background) in spectrogram images.

## Phase 1: Initial CNN Approach (Completed)
- Started with CNN classification approach
- Realized fundamental flaw: CNN does image classification (one label per image) but dataset has YOLO-style bounding boxes (multiple objects per image)
- Documented problem in Problem.md
- Decided to switch to YOLO object detection approach

## Phase 2: YOLO System Development (Completed)

### Data Analysis
- Dataset: spectrogram_training_data_20220711 with 20,000+ labeled spectrograms
- File structure: Each spectrogram has 4 files (raw_data, .png, _marked.png, .txt)
- Class distribution analysis:
  - Background: 329,923 labels (71.3%)
  - WLAN: 73,946 labels (16.0%)
  - Bluetooth: 58,811 labels (12.7%)
  - BLE: 0 labels (0.0%)
- Key finding: BLE class is completely missing from dataset

### System Architecture
- Created YOLO_detection folder with complete system
- Implemented custom YOLO model (SimpleYOLO) with 3 classes
- Built data loader for YOLO format labels
- Created training script with proper YOLO loss function
- Developed testing and visualization tools

### Key Components Created
1. yolo_data_loader.py - Handles YOLO format data loading
2. yolo_model.py - Custom YOLO architecture
3. train_yolo.py - Training script with YOLO loss
4. test_yolo_model.py - Testing and visualization
5. labeling.py - Analysis and verification tools

## Phase 3: Training Results (Problem Identified)

### Training Execution
- Model trained for 2 epochs (stopped early due to time constraints)
- Model parameters: 2,123,547
- Training completed successfully without errors
- Best model saved to checkpoints/best_model.pth

### Training Behavior - CRITICAL ISSUE
- Loss immediately converged to near zero (0.0003)
- This was initially thought to be good performance
- Later analysis revealed this was actually a major problem

### Initial Hypothesis (INCORRECT)
- Thought the model was learning quickly
- Assumed low loss meant good performance
- Did not realize the model was learning to predict zeros

## Phase 4: Testing Results (Problem Confirmed)

### Test Setup
- Created comprehensive testing script with 3-panel visualization
- Tests original spectrogram, model predictions, and human-marked ground truth
- Organized results in yolo_testing_results folder

### Test Results - NO DETECTIONS
- Model consistently predicts "No RF signals detected"
- Tested with confidence thresholds from 0.5 down to 0.01
- Zero detections across all test images

### Debug Analysis - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
Debug mode revealed the actual problem:

```
Raw output shape: torch.Size([1, 3, 9])
Anchor 0: Sigmoid confidence: 0.000000 (raw: -48.1394)
Anchor 1: Sigmoid confidence: 0.000000 (raw: -48.0808) 
Anchor 2: Sigmoid confidence: 0.000000 (raw: -46.3272)
```

### Problem Analysis
1. **Model learned to predict extremely negative confidence values**
2. **Sigmoid of -48 â‰ˆ 0.000000** - model thinks there are no objects
3. **All anchors predict "no object"** regardless of input
4. **Model essentially learned to say "I see nothing"**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Loss Function
- Custom YOLO loss function was too simplified
- Model learned that predicting zeros minimizes loss
- No proper object detection learning occurred

### Secondary Issues
1. **Training Data Imbalance**: 71% Background vs 29% actual signals
2. **Model Architecture**: Simplified YOLO may be insufficient
3. **Training Duration**: Only 2 epochs may be insufficient
4. **Loss Convergence**: Immediate convergence to zero indicates learning failure

### What We Learned
- Low loss does not always mean good performance
- Model can learn to predict zeros to minimize loss
- YOLO loss function is critical for proper object detection
- Need to verify model is actually learning, not just minimizing loss

## Current Status
- YOLO system architecture is complete and functional
- Training infrastructure works correctly
- Model loads and runs without errors
- Problem is in the learning process, not the implementation

## Next Steps Required
1. **Implement proper YOLO loss function** (not simplified version)
2. **Use real YOLO implementation** (YOLOv8) instead of custom model
3. **Verify training data quality** and label accuracy
4. **Implement proper evaluation metrics** during training
5. **Consider data augmentation** to handle class imbalance

## Technical Notes
- Model correctly handles 4 classes (detected from saved checkpoint)
- Image preprocessing works correctly (no resizing, original resolution)
- Coordinate conversion from normalized to pixel coordinates is correct
- Visualization system works properly
- File organization and logging system is complete

## Files Created
- YOLO_detection/ folder with complete system
- yolo_testing_results/ folder for organized test outputs
- Comprehensive documentation and analysis tools
- Debug capabilities for model output analysis

## Key Lesson
The most important lesson learned: **A model that converges to zero loss immediately is not learning - it's failing to learn.** Proper object detection requires sophisticated loss functions that actually teach the model to detect objects, not just minimize a simple loss metric.

## Technical Insight from Team Discussion
**What we discovered about loss functions and overfitting:**

The loss functions (like cross entropy) are basically calculations that measure how "right" the AI is while it's doing its work. They're good indicators of certainty and how accurate the AI can be.

**The problem with our old model:**
- When loss converges too quickly to zero, something is wrong
- Loss is never supposed to be exactly 0
- This can be a sign of overfitting

**What happened in our case:**
The model was overfitting to predict "nothing" - it learned to say "okay this image has nothing, this image has nothing" so it converged to zero loss. Basically it was overfitting to not classify anything at all.

**The real issue:**
The marked zones in the data weren't strange - the strange part was that not everything was marked. The model learned to predict "no objects" for everything, which gave it a perfect loss of zero, but it wasn't actually learning to detect RF signals.

This is why we switched to using real YOLO instead of our custom implementation - the loss functions in real YOLO are much more sophisticated and actually teach the model to detect objects properly.

## How YOLO Validation Works
**Important clarification on how YOLO evaluates performance:**

YOLO validation compares **each predicted bounding box** to **each ground truth bounding box**, not per-image.

**Example:**
- Image has 5 RF signals (ground truth)
- Model detects 3 signals correctly
- Result: 3/5 = 60% accuracy for that image
- **NOT**: 0/1 (image completely wrong)

**Why this makes sense:**
- Partial detection is still valuable
- Finding 3 out of 5 signals is useful progress
- Model learns gradually to detect more signals
- Real-world scenario: you might miss some signals but detect others

**Key point:** YOLO evaluates per-object detection, not per-image classification. So if the model gets 3 out of 5 signals right, that's actually good progress - much better than detecting 0 out of 5 like our old model did.

## Phase 5: Ultralytics YOLOv8 Implementation (Current)

### New System Architecture
- Switched from custom YOLO to Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Created clean YOLO_detection folder with proper implementation
- Moved all custom implementation files to first_test_attempt/ folder
- Implemented standard YOLO training and testing workflow

### Training Results (20 Epochs)
- **Model**: YOLOv8 using Ultralytics framework
- **Training Duration**: 20 epochs (completed successfully)
- **Dataset**: 20,000 spectrogram images with YOLO labels
- **Classes**: 4 classes (Background, WLAN, Bluetooth, BLE)
- **Device**: CUDA (GPU acceleration enabled)
- **Model Location**: yolo_training/rf_detection/weights/best.pt

### Training Behavior Analysis
- **Initial Issue**: Model was identifying everything as Background
- **Root Cause**: Class imbalance (71% Background vs 29% actual signals)
- **Training Strategy**: Model learned to be conservative due to data imbalance
- **Result**: Model tends to predict Background class more frequently

### Enhanced Testing System

  - Automatic analysis notes and recommendations

### Test Results Format
- **Output Directory**: yolo_testing_results/
- **Individual Results**: test_XX_filename.png (2x2 visualization)
- **Summary File**: test_summary.txt with detailed matrix
- **Analysis**: Automatic detection of model behavior issues

### Current Model Performance
- **Status**: Model trained and ready for testing
- **Expected Behavior**: May be conservative due to class imbalance

- CUDA acceleration used throughout training
- Best model automatically saved during training
- Training can be resumed from existing model if needed
- Class imbalance remains a challenge but model should still detect signals
- Seems to be classifying mostly as background
- Need to test accuracy
