# Problem Analysis: Current CNN Approach vs. RF Signal Detection Requirements

## **The Current Problem**

### **What We Have:**
- **PNG files**: Full spectrograms with multiple signals
- **TXT files**: YOLO labels with multiple bounding boxes per image
- **Example**: `result_frame_138769090623611142_bw_25E+6.txt` has **26 different signals** (classes 0, 1, 2)

### **What Our Model Does:**
- **Takes the entire PNG** (1024Ã—192 pixels)
- **Resizes to 224Ã—224** (loses resolution!)
- **Assigns ONE label** to the whole image
- **Ignores individual bounding boxes**

## **The Issues You've Identified**

### **1. Resolution Loss**
```
Original: 1024Ã—192 pixels (high resolution)
Model Input: 224Ã—224 pixels (low resolution)
```
**Problem**: We're losing the fine details needed to distinguish different signals!

### **2. Multiple Signals Ignored**
Looking at your example file:
```
0 0.07385 0.5 0.090863 0.8    # Background signal
1 0.115725 0.5 0.007111 0.8   # WLAN signal  
0 0.137988 0.5 0.051636 0.8   # Background signal
1 0.267959 0.5 0.077531 0.8   # WLAN signal
2 0.920688 0.5 0.010196 0.08   # Bluetooth signal
```

**The image contains 3 different signal types, but our model only predicts ONE!**

### **3. Wrong Approach for RF Signals**
- **RF signals are localized** in specific frequency-time regions
- **Each bounding box** represents a distinct signal
- **We should detect each signal individually**, not classify the whole image

## **What We Should Be Doing**

### **Option 1: Object Detection (YOLO) - RECOMMENDED**
```python
# Instead of classification, use YOLO for detection
Input: Full resolution spectrogram (1024Ã—192)
Output: Multiple bounding boxes with classes
Example: "WLAN at (x1,y1,x2,y2), Bluetooth at (x3,y3,x4,y4)"
```

### **Option 2: Patch-Based Classification**
```python
# Split spectrogram into patches
Input: 1024Ã—192 spectrogram â†’ 64 patches of 128Ã—96 each
Output: Class for each patch
Result: "Patch 1: WLAN, Patch 2: Background, Patch 3: Bluetooth"
```

### **Option 3: Multi-Label Classification**
```python
# Keep full image but predict multiple labels
Input: 1024Ã—192 spectrogram
Output: [WLAN: 0.8, Bluetooth: 0.6, Background: 0.9]
Result: "This image contains WLAN and Bluetooth signals"
```

## **ðŸ”§ Why Our Current Approach is Wrong**

### **1. We're Throwing Away Information**
- **YOLO labels** tell us exactly where each signal is
- **We ignore this** and just pick one "primary" class
- **We lose spatial information** about signal locations

### **2. We're Losing Resolution**
- **RF signals are narrow** in frequency and time
- **224Ã—224 is too low** to see fine details
- **We need higher resolution** to distinguish signals

### **3. We're Not Solving the Right Problem**
- **Hackathon goal**: Detect and classify drones
- **Real-world need**: Find all signals in the spectrum
- **Our approach**: Just guess the dominant signal type

## **What We Should Do Next**

### **Immediate Fix: Use YOLO for Detection**
```python
# Modify our approach to use YOLO
1. Keep original resolution (1024Ã—192)
2. Use YOLO architecture for object detection
3. Train on bounding boxes directly
4. Output: Multiple signals with locations and classes
```

### **Benefits of YOLO Approach:**
- **Preserves resolution** - no downsampling
- **Detects multiple signals** - not just one
- **Provides locations** - where each signal is
- **Matches the data format** - we already have YOLO labels!

## ** The Real Question**

**Should we:**
1. **Keep the current CNN** for quick results (but limited)
2. **Switch to YOLO** for proper signal detection (but more complex)
3. **Use both approaches** - CNN for quick classification, YOLO for detailed detection

**For the hackathon, I recommend Option 3:**
- **CNN**: Fast classification of signal types
- **YOLO**: Precise detection of signal locations
- **Combined**: Best of both worlds!
