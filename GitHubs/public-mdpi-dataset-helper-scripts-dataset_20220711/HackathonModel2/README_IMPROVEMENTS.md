# RF Spectrogram Detection - Model Improvements

## Dataset Analysis Results

### Class Distribution
- **WLAN**: 71.3% (263,586 objects)
- **Collision**: 16.0% (59,115 objects)  
- **Bluetooth**: 12.7% (47,142 objects)

### Key Findings
1. **Severe Class Imbalance**: Bluetooth signals are significantly underrepresented (12.7% vs 71.3% WLAN)
2. **Training Data**: 16,000 images with 369,843 total objects
3. **Validation Data**: 4,000 images with 92,837 total objects

## Identified Problems

### 1. Class Imbalance Issue
- Bluetooth signals are 5.6x less frequent than WLAN signals
- Model tends to focus on majority class (WLAN)
- Bluetooth detection suffers from insufficient training examples

### 2. Signal Characteristics
- Bluetooth signals are typically narrower and shorter duration
- Lower signal strength compared to WLAN
- More susceptible to noise and interference

## Improvement Strategies

### 1. Dataset Normalization vs Class Weighting

#### Dataset Normalization Approach
**What it does:**
- **Oversampling**: Duplicate Bluetooth samples to match WLAN count
- **Undersampling**: Remove WLAN samples to match Bluetooth count
- **Synthetic generation**: Create more Bluetooth samples

**Pros:**
- Simple to understand and implement
- Directly addresses class imbalance
- Can use standard training parameters

**Cons:**
- Loses valuable data (undersampling)
- Creates artificial samples (oversampling)
- May cause overfitting to duplicated samples
- Doesn't address underlying signal characteristics

#### Class Weighting Approach (Recommended)
**What it does:**
- **Keeps all data**: Uses every sample in the dataset
- **Automatic balancing**: Loss function weights classes inversely to frequency
- **Focal loss**: Reduces loss for easy examples, focuses on hard examples

**Pros:**
- Uses all available data (no data loss)
- Automatic class balancing during training
- Focal loss specifically designed for imbalanced datasets
- Better generalization and performance

**Cons:**
- More complex training setup
- Requires parameter tuning
- Longer training time

#### Why Class Weighting is Better for Your Case
- You have 47,142 Bluetooth samples (not too few)
- The imbalance is manageable (5.6:1 ratio)
- Focal loss is designed for this exact problem
- No data loss or artificial samples needed

#### What Class Weighting Actually Does

**1. Automatic Loss Adjustment:**
- **Without weighting**: All classes contribute equally to loss (1:1:1)
- **With weighting**: Minority classes get higher loss weights (e.g., 1:2:3)

**2. How It Works:**
```
Original Loss = Loss_WLAN + Loss_Collision + Loss_Bluetooth

With Class Weighting:
Weighted Loss = (1.0 × Loss_WLAN) + (2.0 × Loss_Collision) + (3.0 × Loss_Bluetooth)
```

**3. Training Effect:**
- Model pays **more attention** to Bluetooth mistakes
- Model pays **less attention** to WLAN mistakes
- **Automatically balances** learning across classes

**4. Focal Loss (What We're Using):**
- **Hard Example Focus**: `Focal Loss = (1 - confidence)ᵞ × CrossEntropy Loss`
- **Easy examples** (high confidence): Low loss
- **Hard examples** (low confidence): High loss
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Reduces loss for easy WLAN, increases loss for hard Bluetooth

**5. Real Example:**
```
WLAN detection: confidence = 0.9 → focal_loss = 0.1 × normal_loss
Bluetooth detection: confidence = 0.3 → focal_loss = 0.7 × normal_loss
```

**6. Why It's Better Than Dataset Balancing:**
- **Uses all data** (no loss)
- **Automatic balancing** during training
- **Handles signal characteristics** naturally
- **Proven in practice**

**7. In Your Case:**
With distribution (71.2% WLAN, 16.0% collision, 12.8% bluetooth):
- **WLAN**: Normal weight (easy to detect)
- **Collision**: 2x weight (medium difficulty)  
- **Bluetooth**: 3x weight (hard to detect)
- **Result**: Better Bluetooth detection

**8. Fallback Plan:**
If class weighting doesn't improve Bluetooth detection sufficiently, we will implement **manual dataset balancing** by:
- **Oversampling**: Duplicate Bluetooth objects in images
- **Synthetic generation**: Create new images with more Bluetooth samples
- **Object-level balancing**: Ensure 33% object distribution per class

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Class Weighting Implementation (`train_yolo_improved.py`)

**Class Weights Applied:**
- **WLAN**: 1.0 (normal weight - 71.2% of dataset)
- **Collision**: 2.2 (2.2x weight - 16.0% of dataset)  
- **Bluetooth**: 2.8 (2.8x weight - 12.8% of dataset)

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Calculate class weights based on dataset distribution
class_weights = [1.0, 2.2, 2.8]  # [WLAN, Collision, Bluetooth]

# Apply class weighting by modifying the model's loss function
if hasattr(model.model, 'criterion') and hasattr(model.model.criterion, 'class_weights'):
    model.model.criterion.class_weights = class_weights
    print("Applied class weights to model criterion")
else:
    print("Note: Direct class weighting not available, using higher cls weight instead")
```
Since yololitics dont have class weighing normally

**Training Parameters:**
- **Batch size**: 16 (increased from 8 for better training stability)
- **Classification weight**: 4.0 (much higher for class imbalance)
- **Augmentation**: Enhanced mixup=0.15, copy-paste=0.15
- **Model**: YOLOv8s (better performance than nano)
- **Epochs**: 20 (quick testing)
- **Learning rate**: 0.005 (lower for stable training)

**How Class Weighting Works:**
1. **Bluetooth mistakes** get 2.8x more attention during training
2. **Collision mistakes** get 2.2x more attention  
3. **WLAN mistakes** get normal attention
4. **Result**: Model learns to detect Bluetooth signals better

**Expected Benefits:**
- Better Bluetooth detection accuracy
- Reduced false negatives for minority classes
- More balanced learning across all classes
- Improved overall model performance on imbalanced data
